# Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the **Contributor Covenant** code of conduct to help build a welcoming and respectful community.  We expect everyone who participates in our projects — including maintainers, contributors and community members — to abide by this code in all project spaces, both online and offline.  The following is a concise summary; the full Contributor Covenant text can be found at [contributor-covenant.org](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct).

## Our pledge

We pledge to foster an open and inclusive environment.  We are dedicated to making participation in this project a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community rather than any one person
- Showing courtesy and professionalism

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- Harassment, intimidation or discrimination in any form
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments and personal attacks
- The publication of private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Any behaviour that would reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.  Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, pull requests or other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or its community.  Examples of representing a project include participating in project meetings, posting via an official social media account or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the PET Initiative maintainers at **conduct@privacyenhancingtech.org**.  All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.  All maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction.**  A private, written warning with clarity around the behaviour in question and an explanation of why it is inappropriate.
2. **Warning.**  A public or private warning, with consequences including removal of privileges or a temporary ban from project spaces.
3. **Temporary ban.**  Removal from project spaces for a specified period.  The individual will be informed of the reason and conditions for reinstatement.
4. **Permanent ban.**  Removal from all project spaces and exclusion from future participation.  This is an irreversible step reserved for the most severe cases.
