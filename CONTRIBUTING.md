# Contributing to the Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PET) Initiative

Thank you for your interest in contributing!  The PET Initiative is a welcoming community of researchers, engineers and enthusiasts working together to make privacy‑enhancing technologies accessible and robust.  We value diversity and encourage contributions from people of all backgrounds and skill levels.

## Ways to contribute

You can contribute in many ways:

1. **Report bugs or issues** — If you notice a problem with one of our repositories, open an issue describing the bug.  Include steps to reproduce the issue, the expected behaviour and any relevant environment details.
2. **Request new features** — Suggest improvements or new functionality by opening a feature request.  Explain the problem you’re trying to solve, why it matters and how your idea might address it.
3. **Submit code or documentation** — Fork the repository and create a branch for your changes.  Submit a pull request (PR) with a clear description of what you’ve changed and why.  See “Development workflow” below for details.
4. **Improve documentation and examples** — Good documentation is vital for adoption.  Help by fixing typos, clarifying instructions or adding tutorials and examples.
5. **Participate in discussions** — Join the mailing list or attend our bi‑weekly calls to provide feedback on proposals, help prioritise work and share your knowledge.

## Development workflow

1. **Before you start**
   - Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [security policy](./SECURITY.md).  We strive to maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment.
   - Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com) and that you are logged in.
   - Sign the Linux Foundation Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before submitting a pull request.  The CLA ensures that contributions can be licensed under the project’s Apache 2.0 license.  You can sign digitally by following the prompts when you open your first PR.

2. **Fork and branch**
   - Navigate to the repository you want to contribute to and click **Fork** to create your own copy under your GitHub account.
   - Clone your fork to your local machine.
   - Create a branch off of `main` for your work.  Use a descriptive name (e.g., `fix-issue-42` or `add-feature-X`).

3. **Make your changes**
   - If you’re fixing a bug, try to add a regression test so the issue doesn’t recur.  If you’re adding a feature, consider adding unit tests.
   - Follow the coding conventions of the project.  For Python projects like **NetDPSyn**, this means adhering to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines and running tools like `black` and `flake8` before committing.
   - Write clear and concise commit messages summarising your changes.

4. **Submit your pull request**
   - Push your branch to your fork and open a PR against the upstream `main` branch.
   - Fill out the provided pull request template.  Clearly describe the purpose of the change, reference any related issues (e.g., “Closes #42”) and list any potential impacts.
   - Ensure your branch is up‑to‑date with `main` and that the continuous integration (CI) checks pass.  If there are merge conflicts, rebase your branch on `main` and resolve them.
   - Please be patient.  Reviewers are volunteers and may take a few days to respond.

5. **Review process**
   - At least one maintainer will review your PR.  They may request changes or ask questions.  Please respond promptly and update your PR as needed.
   - Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR.  You’ll receive credit for your contribution in the project’s history.

6. **After merging**
   - Celebrate 🎉 — You just made PET tools better!  Feel free to continue contributing or help others by reviewing PRs and answering questions.
