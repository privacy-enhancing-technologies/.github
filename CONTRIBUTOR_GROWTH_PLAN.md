# PET Initiative 90‑Day Contributor Growth Plan

This document outlines a three‑month plan to grow our contributor base, improve onboarding and increase community engagement.  The goal is to lower the barrier for new contributors while building momentum around the PET Initiative.

## Month 1 (Days 1–30): Lay the foundation

1. **Publish community health files.**  Merge the organisation‑wide `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md` and issue/PR templates into a `.github` repository so that all PET projects inherit them automatically.
2. **Clean up repository landing pages.**  Update the descriptions and pinned topics for each PET repository on GitHub to clearly state their purpose and link back to the organisation README.
3. **Seed “good first issues.”**  Identify small, well‑scoped tasks (bug fixes, documentation improvements, tests) and label them with `good first issue`.  Aim for at least 3–5 such issues per repository.
4. **Promote the mailing list.**  Send a welcome message on the mailing list announcing the new contribution guidelines and inviting newcomers to introduce themselves.
5. **Plan the first community call.**  Schedule a focused “Onboarding 101” call to walk through the new guidelines, answer questions and solicit feedback.  Record and publish the session.

## Month 2 (Days 31–60): Engage and mentor

1. **Follow up on “good first issues.”**  When a new contributor picks up an issue, ensure a maintainer is assigned to mentor them.  Provide timely and constructive feedback on PRs.
2. **Host office hours.**  Hold informal drop‑in sessions (e.g., 30 minutes every other week) where contributors can ask questions about the codebase or propose ideas.  Rotate hosts among maintainers.
3. **Document common workflows.**  Expand the Wiki with step‑by‑step guides for setting up a development environment, running tests, submitting PRs and attending meetings.
4. **Highlight contributors.**  At the end of the month, call out first‑time contributors in the mailing list and on social media.  Recognise their efforts publicly to encourage continued engagement.

## Month 3 (Days 61–90): Expand reach and evaluate

1. **Plan a mini hackathon or sprint.**  Organise a virtual hackathon focused on building example applications or integrating PET technologies into existing systems.  Encourage cross‑team collaboration and pair programming.
2. **Reach out to academia and industry.**  Invite researchers and companies working on privacy technologies to present at a community meeting.  This helps build partnerships and may attract contributors with specialised expertise.
3. **Evaluate metrics.**  Track progress via metrics such as number of active contributors, issues closed, PRs merged and meeting attendance.  Use these data points to adjust outreach strategies.
4. **Publish roadmap updates.**  Based on community feedback and contributions, update the public roadmap and communicate priorities for the next quarter.  Solicit volunteers to lead specific workstreams.

By following this plan, we hope to cultivate a vibrant contributor community, improve project sustainability and accelerate the adoption of privacy‑enhancing technologies.
